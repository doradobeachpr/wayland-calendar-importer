# 🔧 PHASE 2: Backend Infrastructure Enhancement - Multi-Source Calendar Import Tool

## 🎯 **CURRENT MISSION: NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT ISSUES**

*Phase 1 Complete: All critical user experience issues resolved*
*Phase 2A Progress: Build works locally, but Netlify deployment failing*

---

## 🚀 **CURRENT STATUS - PHASE 2A PROGRESS**

### **✅ Successfully Completed:**
- ✅ **Added @netlify/plugin-nextjs**: Moved to dependencies in package.json
- ✅ **Enhanced Netlify Configuration**: Added NODE_VERSION=20 and proper environment
- ✅ **Fixed Next.js 15 Issues**: Updated serverExternalPackages, removed deprecated options
- ✅ **Resolved TypeScript Errors**: Fixed all compilation errors blocking build
- ✅ **Local Build Success**: All 14 API routes compile as dynamic functions
- ✅ **Database Architecture**: Safe operation wrappers for null connections
- ✅ **Health Check API**: Comprehensive monitoring endpoint created

### **⚠️ Current Blocker: Netlify Deployment**
- ❌ **Local Build**: ✅ Works perfectly with all API routes
- ❌ **Netlify Deployment**: ❌ Still failing despite proper configuration
- ❌ **API Routes Status**: Unknown - deployment doesn't complete

### **🔍 Investigation Needed:**
1. **Deployment Logs**: Need access to specific Netlify build failure details
2. **Plugin Installation**: Verify @netlify/plugin-nextjs installs correctly on Netlify
3. **Environment Variables**: Check if Netlify environment is properly configured
4. **Alternative Approach**: Consider static export with separate API service

## 🛠️ **BACKEND INFRASTRUCTURE ROADMAP**

### **🔧 Priority 1: Fix Netlify Deployment**
- [x] **Updated Netlify Configuration**: Enhanced netlify.toml with forced redirects
- [x] **Enhanced Next.js Config**: Added serverless optimizations
- [x] **Created Health Check API**: /api/health endpoint for monitoring
- [x] **Fixed TypeScript Issues**: All compilation errors resolved
- [x] **Added Netlify Plugin**: @netlify/plugin-nextjs in dependencies
- [x] **Set Node Version**: NODE_VERSION=20 in build environment
- [ ] **🚨 CURRENT**: Diagnose specific Netlify deployment failure
- [ ] **Alternative Strategy**: Consider static export or different deployment approach

### **🗄️ Priority 2: Database Persistence**
- [x] **Enhanced Database Architecture**: Improved connection handling for serverless
- [x] **Netlify-specific Storage**: Using /tmp/.netlify for persistence
- [ ] **Test Database Persistence**: Verify data survives cold starts
- [ ] **Optimize Performance**: Fine-tune for serverless environments

### **📡 Priority 3: Live Calendar Scraping**
- [x] **Fallback Architecture**: Graceful degradation when APIs unavailable
- [ ] **Enable Multi-Source Import**: Get real calendar data from all 10 sources
- [ ] **Test Import Reliability**: Verify scraping works consistently
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Robust handling of blocked/changed sites

### **📊 Priority 4: Production Monitoring**
- [x] **Health Check Endpoints**: Comprehensive /api/health route
- [ ] **Error Logging**: Enhanced error tracking and reporting
- [ ] **Performance Metrics**: Import success rates and timing
- [ ] **Alerting System**: Notifications for system issues

## 🌐 **DEPLOYMENT STATUS**

**🌐 Production URL**: https://wayland.info
**🎯 Current Version**: 38 - Netlify Configuration Fixes
**🔧 Active Issue**: Netlify deployment failure despite successful local build
**📊 Local Status**: ✅ Full functionality, all API routes compiling
**📊 Live Status**: ❌ Deployment not completing

**⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE**: Deployment failing on Netlify despite:
- ✅ Local build success
- ✅ All configuration fixes applied
- ✅ Plugin properly configured
- ✅ Environment variables set

---

## 📈 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

1. **Deployment Debugging**: Get specific Netlify build/deployment error details
2. **Alternative Testing**: Try static export or simplified API setup
3. **Plugin Verification**: Confirm @netlify/plugin-nextjs works with Next.js 15
4. **Environment Check**: Verify all Netlify environment variables are properly set
5. **Fallback Plan**: Consider alternative deployment strategies if needed

**🎯 IMMEDIATE FOCUS**: Resolve Netlify deployment blocker to get API routes online

**📋 SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- API routes respond with 200 instead of 404
- Health check endpoint accessible
- Database operations work in production
- Multi-source import functionality enabled
